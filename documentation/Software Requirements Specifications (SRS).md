## 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive description of the requirements for developing a web-based code generation system. The document is intended for software developers, system architects, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the development and implementation of the system. It serves as a foundation for the technical agreement between development team members and will be used to validate the final implementation.

## 1.2 Scope

The system is a web application that enables users to generate codebase from requirement specifications. The application consists of:

- A RESTful backend service built with Python and Flask
- PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- Google Cloud User Store integration for authentication
- API endpoints for managing projects, specifications, and bullet items

Key functionalities include:

- User authentication and authorization
- Project management with single-user ownership
- Specification creation and management within projects
- Hierarchical organization of bullet items within specifications
- Code generation based on requirement specifications

The system does not include:

- Code deployment capabilities
- Version control integration
- Collaborative editing features
- Code execution or testing functionality

# 2. Product Description

  - Update project details
  - Delete projects

- Specification Management
  - Create specifications within projects
  - Retrieve specifications by ID
  - Update specification content
  - Delete specifications
  - Associate specifications with projects

- Bullet Item Management
